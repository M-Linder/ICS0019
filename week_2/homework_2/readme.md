# Homework 2

Part A located in ``/plain_SQL`` directory.

Part B located in ``/SQLALchemy`` directory.

Each directory contains two files.

* The **__create** file which contains the creation and population scripts.
* And the **__queries** file. Which contains the mandated SQL queries for each of the tables.

The Create files will both create the database file if not already present and clear it if it already exists.
